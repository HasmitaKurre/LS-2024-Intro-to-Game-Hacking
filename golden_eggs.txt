Part 2: Golden Eggs

Objective:

To find and collect all 10 golden eggs scattered around the island and retrieve the flag.
Strategy:

    Preparation:
        Research: Understand the possible locations and hiding spots for the golden eggs.
        Equipments: Gather essential tools like a map, compass, and possibly detection equipment if available.
        Skills: Develop necessary skills such as navigation, detection, and quick movement.

    Analysis of the Binary:
        Decompilation: Decompile the binary to investigate the global variable g_eggs in the .bss section.
        Egg Locations: Identify if the binary contains hardcoded locations or any patterns related to the eggs.
        Exploitation: Use any discovered patterns or addresses to narrow down potential egg locations.

    Path Planning:
        Map Study: Analyze the map of the island to plan the most efficient route to search for the eggs.
        Waypoints: Set waypoints for systematic searching to ensure no area is missed.

    Detection and Collection:
        Detection Tools: Use tools like metal detectors or any in-game hints to locate the eggs.
        Collection Process: Develop a script to automate or assist in the collection process.

    Execution:
        Entry: Start from a known location and begin the systematic search.
        Engagement: Engage with any game mechanics or enemies encountered during the search.
        Collection: Collect each egg and mark its location to avoid duplication.
        Completion: After collecting all 10 eggs, retrieve the flag as prompted.
